Original README:

# AdbFileManager
Alternative for the MTP which is slow AF. It uses adb protocol to copy files which is lot faster

To use this app, you must have enabled USB Debugging in android developer settings.     
After enabling it, just go to the directory from where you want to copy from/where to copy, select the file(s) and hit the arrow to the correct copy direction       
Note: to go up a directory, double click the file header!

Note2: Its made in C# and Windows Forms. To put it on Linux/Mac I would completely have to rewrite it, so no Linux/Mac version

# If the app doesn't work install .NET 7 runtime!
 https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0/runtime

# controls:    
 double click folder to go in it    
 double click header to go back a directory    
 click the arrow buttons between the two file explorers to copy file in that direction    
 
 press up/down cursor keys to change selected file/directory in list    
 press enter to go to currently selected directory    
 press backspace to go up a directory
